# basic_game01
A small game with a main menu, player selection screen movement && collisions.
I wanted to try my hands at creating a basic frame-work to start out the majority of my game project ideas using Game Maker game engine.
This is just a super rough project which took me 3 days to complete, I am very proud that I used mostly built-in functions instead of complex code which I would not have been able to explain.
